<!-- description: Prioritize research <name> - assigns ID, moves to backlog -->
# ff-research-prioritise

Run this command followed by the research topic name.

```bash
ff research-prioritise {{ARG_SYNTAX}}
```

This assigns an ID to the research topic and moves it from `01-inbox/` to `02-backlog/`.

Next step: Run `ff research-start <ID>` to begin research.
