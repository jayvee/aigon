<!-- description: Create feature <name> - creates spec in inbox -->
# aigon-feature-create

Run this command followed by the feature name.

```bash
aigon feature-create {{ARG_SYNTAX}}
```

This creates a new feature spec in `./docs/specs/features/01-inbox/`.

Next step: Edit the spec, then run `aigon feature-prioritise {{ARG_SYNTAX}}` to assign an ID and move to backlog.
