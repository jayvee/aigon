Spawn teammates to investigate different questions in parallel with adversarial debate — have them challenge each other's findings. Use delegate mode so you coordinate without researching yourself. Reference: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams\n",
    "AGENT_TEAMS_FEATURE_NOTE": "\n### Agent Teams (optional)\n\nFor features with multiple independent acceptance criteria spanning different areas (e.g., frontend, backend, tests), consider creating an agent team. Assign each teammate a distinct slice of the implementation with clear file ownership boundaries to avoid conflicts. Use delegate mode and require plan approval before teammates begin implementing. Reference: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams\n",
    "PERMISSION_SAVE_NOTE": "\n## Saving Permissions\n\nWhen the user says \"save that permission\", \"remember that\", or asks you to persist a permission you were just granted:\n\n1. Read `.claude/settings.json`\n2. Add the tool pattern to the `permissions.allow` array\n3. Write the updated file\n4. Confirm what you saved\n\nUse the narrowest pattern that covers the user's intent:\n- Specific: `Bash(npm test)`, `Bash(git push:*)`\n- Broad: `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(node:*)`\n\nPrefer specific patterns — broad Bash allows can be chained to bypass deny rules. Ask the user if unsure whether to save narrowly or broadly.\n"
