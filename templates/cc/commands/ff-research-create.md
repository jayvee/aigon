# ff-research-create

Run this command followed by the research topic name.

```bash
ff research-create {{args}}
```

This creates a new research topic in `./docs/specs/research-topics/01-inbox/`.

Next step: Edit the topic, then run `ff research-prioritise {{args}}` to assign an ID and move to backlog.
