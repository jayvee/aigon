# Aigon Specs

**This folder is the Single Source of Truth.**

## Areas
1. `features/` for implementation specs and delivery workflow
2. `research-topics/` for investigation work
3. `feedback/` for raw user/customer input and triage

## Rules
1. READ ONLY: backlog, inbox, done.
2. WRITE: Only edit code if feature spec is in features/in-progress.
