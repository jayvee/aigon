# Purpose
I want the ability to open all the worktrees for a particular feature in arena mode, in a way that is side by side in the terminal window.
Use warp as the starting point for testing this.

# Functionality
I run /open-worktrees 108 and it opens all configured worktrees side by side and commences the implementation of all of them in parallel
