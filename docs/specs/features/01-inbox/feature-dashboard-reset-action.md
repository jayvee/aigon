# Feature: dashboard-reset-action

## Summary

Add a Reset action to dashboard feature cards that wraps aigon feature-reset. Destructive action with confirmation dialog. Available on in-progress, in-evaluation, and paused features, not just in-progress. Routes through the central action registry in lib/feature-workflow-rules.js. Depends on the fix-feature-reset-engine-state-cleanup bug being fixed first so the dashboard action leaves the feature in a fully clean state.

## Validation
<!-- Optional: commands the iterate loop runs after each iteration (in addition to project-level validation).
     Use for feature-specific checks that don't fit in the general test suite.
     All commands must exit 0 for the iteration to be considered successful.

```bash
# Example: node --check aigon-cli.js
```

## Technical Approach
<!-- High-level approach, key decisions, constraints, non-functional requirements -->

## Dependencies
<!-- Other features, external services, or prerequisites.
     For Aigon feature dependencies use: depends_on: feature-name-slug
     This enables ordering enforcement — dependent features can't start until deps are done. -->
