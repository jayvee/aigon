# Feature: spec-review-session-peek

<!-- Authoring AI: set `complexity:` using this rubric before writing the spec:
       low       — config tweaks, doc-only, single-file helpers, trivial bug fixes
       medium    — standard feature with moderate cross-cutting, one command handler, small refactor
       high      — multi-file changes, new public surfaces, judgment-heavy deletion work
       very-high — architectural shifts, contract-breaking changes, new invariants, cross-cutting work that spans multiple subsystems
     At start time, model and effort defaults come from each agent's complexity-defaults
     table (not from this spec). Do not put model IDs in the spec. -->

## Summary
When a feature or research item is in a spec-review or spec-revision cycle, the dashboard must expose the live tmux session with the same peek/open controls used for implementation, evaluation, and code-review sessions. Today the backend can create and discover `spec-review` tmux sessions, but the main card renderer only shows spec-review session blocks in the fallback layout for cards without active agent sections. The result is a card that can display "Spec Review / <agent> - Reviewing" while offering no way to peek at or open the tmux pane.

## User Stories
- [ ] As an operator, I can peek at a live spec-review session directly from the dashboard card while the review is running.
- [ ] As an operator, I can open the live spec-review/spec-revision session in my terminal from the same card section.
- [ ] As an operator, I see consistent session controls for spec review, spec revision, code review, implementation, and evaluation sessions.
- [ ] As an operator, submitted spec-review sessions that are still alive remain peekable for forensics or follow-up.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `feature.specReviewSessions`, `feature.specRevisionSessions`, and `feature.specCheckSessions` render on dashboard cards in every relevant layout branch, including cards that also have active agent sections.
- [ ] The existing reviewer-section UI renders a peek button whenever a spec-review/spec-revision DTO has a session name.
- [ ] The existing reviewer-section UI renders an "Open" action when the underlying spec-review/spec-revision tmux session is alive, even if the workflow state says the review has been submitted or is pending revision.
- [ ] `/api/peek/:id/:agent` can resolve live `spec-review`, `spec-revise`, and `spec-check` sessions for both feature and research entities, in addition to the existing implementation/eval/code-review fallbacks.
- [ ] The read model reports live tmux state for spec-review and spec-revision rows without changing workflow lifecycle semantics; a pending submitted review may remain `status: pending` while still exposing live session controls.
- [ ] Research spec-review cards receive the same peek/open behavior as feature spec-review cards.
- [ ] Existing implementation, evaluation, code-review, set-level spec-review, and autonomous peek controls continue to work.
- [ ] Tests or focused assertions cover the dashboard render helper/read-model behavior and the `/api/peek` session resolution path for `spec-review`.

## Validation
<!-- Optional: commands the iterate loop runs after each iteration (in addition to project-level validation).
     Use for feature-specific checks that don't fit in the project's general checks.
     All commands must exit 0 for the iteration to be considered successful.
     Leave the block below empty or remove it if there is nothing feature-specific to run. -->
```bash
npm test
node -c aigon-cli.js
```

## Pre-authorised
<!-- Optional: grant specific policy-gate skips for this feature only.
     Each line is a single bullet authorising one action. When an agent proceeds
     under a line, the commit footer must be `Pre-authorised-by: <slug>` where
     `<slug>` is the slugified line text (lowercase, non-alphanumerics → hyphens).
     Slugs are validated against this section at feature-close — invented footers block close. -->

## Technical Approach
Relevant current behavior:

- `lib/dashboard-actions/launch-spec-review.js` creates sessions using roles such as `spec-review` and `spec-revise`.
- `lib/workflow-read-model.js` already builds `specReviewSessions` and `specCheckSessions` from `snapshot.specReview`.
- `lib/dashboard-collect/feature-poll.js` and `lib/dashboard-collect/collect-research.js` already include those arrays in dashboard DTOs.
- `templates/dashboard/js/pipeline.js` only renders spec-review sections in the fallback card branch for cards without active agents. The active-agent branch renders agents, eval, and code-review sessions, then skips spec-review sessions entirely.
- `lib/dashboard-routes/sessions.js` has a generic `/api/peek/:id/:agent` fallback that checks implementation/eval/code-review session names but not spec-review roles.

Implementation plan:

1. Extract a small `buildSpecReviewSectionsHtml(feature)` helper in `templates/dashboard/js/pipeline.js` that renders:
   - `feature.specReviewSessions` as `buildReviewerSectionHtml('Spec Review', row, { mode: 'spec' })`
   - `feature.specRevisionSessions || feature.specCheckSessions` as `buildReviewerSectionHtml('Spec Revision', row, { mode: 'spec-revise' })`
2. Append that helper in all card branches that can render a non-done item, especially the active-agent branch near the existing code-review section.
3. Update `buildReviewerSectionHtml()` so the Open button keys off live session state rather than strictly `reviewer.running === true`. Keep the visible status text driven by workflow status so submitted/pending reviews still read correctly.
4. Update `readSpecReviewSessions()` and `readSpecCheckSessions()` in `lib/workflow-read-model.js` to include live tmux information, for example `sessionRunning: Boolean(session && tmuxSessionExists(session))`. Preserve `status`, `source`, and `running` meanings unless the current code already treats `running` as tmux liveness for that row.
5. Extend `/api/peek/:id/:agent` in `lib/dashboard-routes/sessions.js` to search `spec-review`, `spec-revise`, and `spec-check` roles for both `f` and `r`. Prefer using existing session-name parsing/helpers rather than hardcoding one fragile exact name.
6. Add focused tests around the changed helper/read-model/route behavior if the local test structure has existing dashboard tests. If no suitable harness exists, add the narrowest test that exercises the exported/readable logic without requiring a real dashboard browser.

Known reproduction from local diagnosis:

- Feature F649 had a live tmux session named `aigon-f649-spec-review-cx-nudge-confirm-robust-codex-wrap`.
- `.aigon/sessions/aigon-f649-spec-review-cx-nudge-confirm-robust-codex-wrap.json` recorded `role: "spec-review"`.
- The dashboard card displayed a spec-review row but did not expose a peek button in the primary card layout.

## Dependencies
<!-- Other features, external services, or prerequisites.
     For Aigon feature dependencies use: depends_on: feature-name-slug
     This enables ordering enforcement — dependent features can't start until deps are done. -->
- None.

## Out of Scope
- Redesigning dashboard card hierarchy or changing state labels.
- Changing workflow lifecycle transitions for spec review or spec revision.
- Changing how spec-review sessions are launched.
- Adding new terminal/pty infrastructure.

## Open Questions
- None known.
