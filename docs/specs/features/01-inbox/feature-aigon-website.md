# Purpose
Currently, the GitHub README page and other README-related markdown files in the GitHub repo are the source of truth for describing what Aigon is and what Aigon does. Many competitors with open source libraries like Aigon have a dedicated website which showcases the use of Aigon, includes things like videos, includes detailed documentation, and is really a marketing starting point for the library. This feature is to build a static website for Aigon
