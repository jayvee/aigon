# Purpose
Simplify aigon installation and update by using a single AGENT.md file and a single set of skills.
Right now we have templates that write instructions to multiple agent md files and multiple registries of skills. The aim is to simplify this and reduce repitiation in files created, which simplifies the taget repos.
