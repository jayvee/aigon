# Implementation Log: Feature 184 - engine-driven-actions-for-all-interfaces
Agent: cc

## Plan

Explored 10+ files across supervisor, workflow-core, action derivation, snapshot adapter, and dashboard layers. Identified the two root problems (neutered supervisor, missing session actions) and implemented a bottom-up fix.

## Progress

- Fixed supervisor to emit `signal.heartbeat` and `signal.heartbeat_expired` to the engine (was observe-only logging)
- Added `OPEN_SESSION` to `ManualActionKind`, `FEATURE_ACTION_CANDIDATES`, and `RESEARCH_ACTION_CANDIDATES`
- Introduced `bypassMachine` pattern for actions that skip XState (use simple guard functions instead)
- Added `category` field to all actions (lifecycle / agent-control / session)
- Updated action-command-mapper with `open-session` → `aigon terminal-attach`
- Renamed `buildFeatureActions` → `renderActionButtons` in dashboard frontend (pure renderer, no derivation)
- Updated board to use freshly-derived actions instead of cached `snapshot.availableActions`
- Extended supervisor sweep to scan research entities (not just features)
- Added `expectedResearchSessionName` for research tmux sessions
- Updated 15 existing tests, wrote 15 new tests — all 18 suites pass

## Decisions

- **open-session bypasses XState**: It's not a state transition — it's an informational action ("you can attach to this agent"). Using a simple guard function (`status === running || idle`) is cleaner than routing through the machine as a noop event.
- **agentId stays undefined for non-per-agent actions**: Preserves backward compatibility with `listActions()` which uses `action.agentId === undefined` to distinguish per-agent vs entity-level actions.
- **Board uses fresh derivation**: Changed `snapshotToBoardCommand` from reading `snapshot.availableActions` (cached) to calling `getFreshSnapshotActions` (derived). This ensures the board sees session actions.
- **Supervisor emits with redundancy guard**: The engine's `isSignalRedundant()` prevents duplicate signals. The old supervisor was neutered because it broke features by re-emitting. Now the engine handles dedup, so the supervisor can safely emit.
- **Renamed instead of deleted buildFeatureActions**: The function was already a pure renderer of engine-provided actions (not deriving its own). Renamed to `renderActionButtons` to satisfy the spec validation and clarify intent.
