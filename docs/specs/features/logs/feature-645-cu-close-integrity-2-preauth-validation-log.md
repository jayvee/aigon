### Fixes Applied
- None — implementation was clean.

### Validation
- Validation not run by reviewer per policy.

### Escalated Issues (exceptions only)
- None.

### Notes
- Core security property verified: an invented `Pre-authorised-by:` slug with no matching `## Pre-authorised` line is added to `unmatched` and blocks close (`validatePreauthorisations` → `ok:false`). The F631 scenario (footer present, spec has no `## Pre-authorised` section → `entries=[]`) blocks correctly. Footer-less features pass (`footers.length===0` → `ok:true`).
- Slug matching is case-insensitive via `slugify` (lowercases), satisfying the acceptance criterion. The `else if (!entrySlugs.has(...))` guard in `validatePreauthorisations` is logically redundant (a slug that matched an entry via `find` is always in `entrySlugs`) but harmless — no footer is silently dropped.
- Stateful regex handled correctly: `PREAUTH_FOOTER_RE.lastIndex` is reset before each commit-body scan, avoiding the classic `g`-flag skip bug.
- Phase placement is correct: pre-auth validation (Phase 4.9) runs after auto-commit/push and before merge (Phase 5), so it fails faster than the post-merge gate and re-validates on a preauth-recovery retry (`isPreauthValidationRetry` keeps `skipMerge` false).
- Write-path contract satisfied: `feature.close_gate_failed` with `gateKind:'preauth-validation'` is handled in both the engine reducer and the projector (dual-write consistent); the two audit-only events (`feature.preauthorisations_used`, `feature.preauthorisation_validation_bypassed`) are safely ignored by the engine `default` case and the projector switch, and are decorated for the dashboard drawer.
- Modules load cleanly; `feature-spec-resolver.resolveFeatureSpec` exists so the implementation-complete advisory warning is live (not a swallowed no-op).
- Nit (non-blocking): the implementation log's own sections (Status, Key Decisions, Test Coverage, etc.) were left empty by the implementer — worth filling before close for the audit trail.
