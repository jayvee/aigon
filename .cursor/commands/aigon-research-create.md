# aigon-research-create

Run this command followed by the research topic name.

```bash
aigon research-create <args>
```

This creates a new research topic in `./docs/specs/research-topics/01-inbox/`.

## Before writing the research topic

Explore the codebase to understand the current state of the area under research. Plan your approach before writing. Consider:

- What existing code or patterns are relevant to this research?
- What has already been tried or decided in this area?
- What specific gaps in understanding need to be filled?

Use this understanding to write focused **Questions to Answer** and well-defined **Scope** sections.

Next step: Once the topic is complete, run `/aigon-research-prioritise <args>` to assign an ID and move to backlog.
