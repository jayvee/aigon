# aigon-research-prioritise

Run this command followed by the research topic name.

```bash
aigon research-prioritise <args>
```

This assigns an ID to the research topic and moves it from `01-inbox/` to `02-backlog/`.

Next step: Run `aigon research-setup <ID>` (solo) or `aigon research-setup <ID> cc gg` (arena) to begin.
